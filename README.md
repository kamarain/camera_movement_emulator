# camera_movement_emulator
Matlab code to create artificial camera movement (e.g. hand shake) sequence from an input image.

Matlab code for the mosaic generation and evaluation framesworks introduced in
 * Image Based Quantitative Mosaic Evaluation with Artificial Video (P. Paalanen, J.-K. Kamarainen and H. Kälviäinen), In Scandinavian Conf. on Image Analysis (SCIA2009), 2009. [PDF](https://webpages.tuni.fi/vision/data/publications/scia2009_mosaic.pdf)

Authors:

 * [Joni Kamarainen](https://github.com/kamarain/) - "Refreshed" old code for this repo

## Interactive demo

With the interactive demo you can generate a sequence of artificial video define by manually entered path
that includes image center points and camera angles. Just run

```
>> demo_interactive
```

and the demo will instruct you through.
